# 911 AI Predict
## The 911 Artificial Intelligence Platform for Recognition of Emergencies through DIrected ClassificaTion
## Abstract
Modern technology is transforming emergency response processes with the 911 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform for Recognition of Emergencies through Directed Classification (911-AI-PREDICT) system.
By utilizing the capabilities of real-time AI-driven decision assistance, this system seeks to enhance the early and accurate detection of life-threatening medical situations reported through 911 calls. 
A real-time transcriber and a real-time classifier make up the system, which works in tandem to extract crucial information from emergency calls and identify potentially fatal conditions. 
The 911-AI-PREDICT system enables the quick and correct allocation of resources to emergency scenarios, providing speedy and efficient emergency medical services (EMS) care. 
It does this by merging AI components with existing emergency dispatch systems. Transcription models, data connecting models, and ML classification models are all used in the system's implementation. 
Future work will involve expanding call-relevant features, enabling data linkage for non-standard locations, fine-tuning the model, creating the whole end-to-end solution, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation. 
By providing prompt and accurate assistance to people in life-threatening situations, the implementation of the 911-AI-PREDICT system has the potential to save lives and change how emergency response is conducted.
